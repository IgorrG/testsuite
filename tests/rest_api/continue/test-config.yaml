    summary: Test continuing on from the RESTful API back to the dialplan
    description: |
        "This exhaustively tests the continue operation on channel resource. The
        channel is entered into Stasis and then continued to the dialplan in a particular
        location. At that location, the channel then re-enters Stasis. Each time the
        channel enters Stasis, the channel gives its current dialplan location as an
        application argument. The Stasis application checks this against its expected
        entrance locations in order to determine if the continuation put the channel
        into the expected place in the dialplan.

        The dialplan also has 'traps' that will emit UserEvents that will automatically
        fail the test if the channel reaches that extension."
