        "Test subscriptions when originating a non-local channel to another
        Stasis app."
    description: |
        "This test creates two Stasis apps each with a separate websocket and a
        PJSIP phone 'alice'. Once both websockets are established and the phone
        has registered, a PJSIP channel is originated from AppA with specifying
        app AppB.

        This test verifies that the 'alice' channel has been subscribed to by
        the AppB Stasis app and AppB receives a StasisStart ARI event for the
        channel. It also ensures AppA does not receive any of the ARI events
        that is expected for AppB to receive."
