        "Verify StasisStart and StasisEnd events when channels are put into a
         Stasis application, bridged, and one channel is blind transferred to
         a non-stasis application."
    description: |
         "Upon the kick off local channel entering into the Stasis(testsuite)
         app, a Stasis bridge is created and two calls are placed using sipp
         accounts ('alice' & 'bob') with both dialing into the
         Stasis(testsuite,test) app. The alice & bob channels are placed into
         the Stasis bridge.

         Alice blind transfers bob to the Echo application via
         dial plan extension 1000. The local channel half replacing Alice's
         channel is added to the bridge with Bob. The other local channel half
         executes the Echo application and is not added to a
         bridge. The StasisStart events for all channels along with the
         StasisEnd event for Alice's channel are verified by this point in time

         A StasisEnd event for Alice's channel triggers an AMI hangup of Bob's
         channel. A StasisEnd event for Bob's channel then triggers an AMI
         hangup of the local channels halves used for the transfer, the local
         channel halves for kicking off the test, and destruction of the bridge.
         The StasisEnd events are verified for Bob's channel and the local
         channel halves used for the transfer."
