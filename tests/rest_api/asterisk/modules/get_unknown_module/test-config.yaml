    summary: 'Offnominal get_module test that receives invalid modules using ARI'
    description: |
        Test that checks when someone tries to get a module that is
        noloaded in the modules.conf configuration, and when someone
        has entered in an invalid module name. The test also checks
        to make sure that a '404 Not Found' was received back as the
        response from the requests.

        * Receives 404 for noloaded module that doesn't exist
        * Receives 404 for module name that doesn't exist
