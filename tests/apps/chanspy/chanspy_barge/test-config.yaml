    summary:     'Test Chanspy with the \"B\" option for barging in on both channels.'
    description: |
        'This test verifies basic functionality of using ChanSpy with the 
         barge option set. MixMonitor is used to record the audio on the
         spied on channel to verify the barging spy channel audio is received.  
         Also, since the Wait() application is used during barge, this verifies 
         that the behavior of transmitting silence during ast_safe_sleep works with
         transmit_silence=yes configured in asterisk.conf. Without transmitting
         silence during wait, the barge audio will not be mixed and this test will
         fail.'
