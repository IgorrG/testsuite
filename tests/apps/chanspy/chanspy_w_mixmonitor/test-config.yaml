    summary:     'Test Chanspy with MixMonitor'
    description: |
        'This test verifies basic functionality of using both ChanSpy
         and MixMonitor on the same channel.  Three pjsua end points call
         into Asterisk playing back an audio file.  As each end point
         calls and hangs up the ChanSpy channel attaches to a different
         channel.  After all three end points have been spied on the 
         MixMonitor audio file is analyzed to verify there was audio
         recorded.'
