    description: |
        'This test runs two instances of Asterisk. One has shared_lastcall set in queues.conf
        and the other does not. Each instance of Asterisk contains two queues with the same two
        members in each queue. We place calls to the queues in a way such that we can properly
        see if wrapuptime is honored.'
