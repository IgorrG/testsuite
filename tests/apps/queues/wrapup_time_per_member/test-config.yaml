    summary:     'Test wrapuptime for queue and member'
    description: |
        'This test runs in one instance of Asterisk. We set a one queue with two members.
        One member has set the wrapuptime and other no. We place calls to the queue
        in a way such that we can properly   see if wrapuptime is honored per the member
        and queue setting.'
