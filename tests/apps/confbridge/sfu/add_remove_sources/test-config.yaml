    summary:     'Ensure that ConfBridge and PJSIP in SFU reinvite appropriately when channels add/remove sources'
    description: |
        'Two SIPp scenarios call into Asterisk which drops them both into a ConfBridge conference bridge. The
        bridge is configured with SFU video support and the calls include video streams. Upon entering each side
        is reinvited with an additional video stream of the other participant. Once this is done the second
        participant adds an additional video source. A reinvite is then sent to the first participant adding an
        additional video stream for this new source. The second participant then removes the new video source
        and a reinvite is sent to the first participant removing the just added video stream. The second
        participant leaves and another reinvite is sent to the first participant removing the video stream for
        the other participant that just left. The first participant then hangs up and the test ends.'
