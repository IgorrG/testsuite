    summary: 'Ensure that Confbridge user timeouts work as expected'
    description: |
        'This test configures a ConfBridge user profile that has a timeout of 10 seconds.
        Alice calls into the ConfBridge. We expect that she will be removed from the
        ConfBridge after 10 seconds.
        Bob first calls into the CONFBRIDGE dialplan function to set his timeout to 5 seconds.
        We expect that he will be removed from the ConfBridge after 5 seconds.
        We ensure that both Bob and Alice have their CONFBRIDGE_RESULT channel variable set
        to "TIMEOUT" when they are removed from the ConfBridge.'
