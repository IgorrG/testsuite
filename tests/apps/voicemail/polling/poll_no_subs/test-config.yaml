    summary: 'Test polling of mailboxes with no subscriptions'
    description: |
        This test verifies that polling a mailbox with no subscriptions does
        not trigger a notification that a change was made. The test will end
        after a short playback, and if an event for mailbox polling is detected
        during that time, the test will fail.
