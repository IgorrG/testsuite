    summary: 'Test polling of a single mailbox'
    description: |
        This test verifies that polling a single mailbox works as intended. A fake
        message is added to the mailbox that triggers an event when the polling
        frequency timeout is reached, which will cause the test to then remove the
        message to end the test.
