    summary: 'Test polling of multiple mailboxes'
    description: |
        This test verifies that polling multiple mailboxes works as intended. A fake
        message is added to various mailboxes that triggers events when the polling
        frequency timeout is reached, which will cause the test to then remove the
        messages and end the test.
