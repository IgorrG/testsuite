    summary: 'Verify the keep_alive_interval setting for the PJSIP stack'
    description: |
        This test verifies the keep_alive_interval setting for the PJSIP stack
        in Asterisk. It sets the keep_alive_interval to 2 seconds, makes a
        TCP client connection to the PJSIP stack, and then waits for 5 keep
        alives. Upon receiving 5 packets, it disconnects and stops the test.
        In all cases, the test verifies on stopping:
         * That 5 total packets were received
         * That the time deltas between packets were received within
           approximately 2 seconds of each other
         * That the keep alive values are all '\r\n\r\n'
