    summary: 'Ensure that proper URI is rewritten on SIP responses'
    description: |
        'This test has SIPp place a call to Asterisk. The SIPp scenario
        represents a proxy in the path to some endpoint. The INVITE that the
        SIPp scenario sends has Record-Route headers in it. We ensure that
        Asterisk does not attempt to rewrite the Contact header in the INVITE
        despite the fact that the rewrite_contact option is enabled. We instead
        ensure that the top-most Record-Route header is rewritten. We then hang
        up the call, and we ensure that the request URI and the route set in
        the BYE is correct.'
