        'This test has Asterisk place an outbound call to a SIPp scenario,
        which represents a proxy in the path to some endpoint. The 200 OK
        response that SIPp sends has no Record-Route headers in it. We ensure
        that Asterisk does rewrite the Contact header in the SIP response.'
