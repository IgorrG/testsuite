    summary: 'Ensure that proper URI is rewritten on SIP responses'
    description: |
        'This test has SIPp place a call to Asterisk. The SIPp scenario
        represents a proxy in the path to some endpoint. The INVITE that the
        SIPp scenario sends has Record-Route headers in it. We ensure that
        Asterisk does not attempt to rewrite the Contact header in the INVITE
        despite the fact that the rewrite_contact option is enabled. We instead
        ensure that the top-most Record-Route header is rewritten. Also we verify
        that if a re-invite w/o a Record-Route does not cause the contact to be
        updated. We then hang up the call, and we ensure that the request URI
        and the route set in the BYE is correct.'
