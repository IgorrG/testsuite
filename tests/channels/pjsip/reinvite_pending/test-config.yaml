    summary: 'Ensure graceful operation when receiving a 491 response on a reinvite.'
    description: |
        'A SIPp scenario places a call into Asterisk. Once the call has been answered, we
        trigger a reinvite by calling the CONNECTEDLINE() dialplan function. The SIPp
        scenario responds to the reinvite with a 491 response. Asterisk then waits a small
        amount of time (approximately 2 seconds) and then sends a new reinvite. The SIPp
        scenario responds this time with a 200 OK, and then hangs up the call.

        The reason this test exists is because there was an issue in Asterisk 12+ for a time
        where reception of a 491 response in Asterisk would result in a crash due to improper
        reference counting of a PJSIP structure. This test ensures that the code changes have
        fixed the issue as expected.'
