    summary: 'Test various SIP Hold scenarios in chan_pjsip using inactive streams'
    description: |
        This tests SIP Hold, where one SIP phone puts another SIP phone on hold by
        sending a re-INVITE with a modified SDP containing a restricted audio
        direction with and without an IP address of 0.0.0.0. Restricted audio
        direction is also tested for unholding by a re-INVITE without an SDP.
        A scenario checks that the correct codec is selected after unholding.
