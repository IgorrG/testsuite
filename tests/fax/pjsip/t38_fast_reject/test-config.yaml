        'Test that asterisk does not drop the call after it rejects the T38
        reinvite from the carrier side because customer does not suport it.
        The 488 response time is measured to make sure it happends quckly.'

# You might think that this test can easily be converted to a sipp.SIPpTestCase
# pluggable test.  After all, SIPp has this timeout attribute feature to required
# <recv> messages.  Unfortunately it didn't abort the call and exit with an error
# code when the 488 came in after the timeout.  In fact it didn't seem to make
# any difference in the SIPp scenario behavior.
