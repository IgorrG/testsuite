    summary: 'Verify the strict RTP functionality of the RTP stack'
    description: |
        This test verifies that during a call with strict RTP and symmetric RTP
        enabled that the act of sending multiple RTP packets at the same time
        does not cause media to be taken away from the existing target. The test
        listens for RTCP events which indicate media is flowing. The target RTP
        address information is extracted from these and multiple basic RTP packets
        sent. If any UDP traffic is received on the port that the packets were
        sent from the test fails. If no packets are received the test passes.
