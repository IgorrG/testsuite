    summary:     'Test that feature timeout does not cause a hangup to get dropped'
    description: |
        'This test creates a small chain of Local channels with the DTMF based transfer
         features enabled. The features are configured to require a # DTMF and a digit in
         order to trigger the transfers. Once the chain is answered SendDTMF is used to
         send a single # which causes a feature timeout to occur. The # DTMF is streamed
         out to the called dialplan logic. This dialplan logic immediately hangs up when
         a single DTMF digit is received. This test confirms that all channels involved
         are hung up when this leg of the chain is hung up.'
